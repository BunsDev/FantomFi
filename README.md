### 🕵️ What is DeFi?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology that challenges the current centralized banking system. DeFi eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services and promotes the use of peer-to-peer, or P2P, transactions.

## ☄️ What's next?

FantomFi has been an amazing project to learn from and the chain Fantom is quiet a fascinating chain with most of it's own tools to work with and as emerging and enthusiastic builders we are all up for the challenge to improve and consistently work on the product. We are also planning on adding more stuff to build on for users to make building in DeFi with Fantom a lot more convenient and easier.
